# CIE302-Fall17
Operating Systems Course Project - Simulating the Code of a Virtual Memory manager in an Operating System (C++/C)

In this Project, we managed to access data with Addresses in 'addresses.txt' from 'BACKING_STORE.bin'

We simulate the RAM using an array  of 'FRAME's called 'MAIN_MEMORY', we simulate page table using an array of 'PAGETABLE_ELEMENT's called 'PAGE_TABLE'
and the TLB using and array of 'TLB_ELEMENT's called 'TLB'.

The Code is very-well commented, and divided into sections.
